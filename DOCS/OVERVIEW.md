## ðŸŽ¯ Core Concept

**"The Decision Layer of the Internet"**

We're solving decision fatigue by building an AI-powered recommendation engine that:

- Understands context (time, mood, location)
- Learns from actual choices, not surveys
- Expands from entertainment to all life decisions
- Creates the "aha moment" when users realize the system knows them better than they know themselves
